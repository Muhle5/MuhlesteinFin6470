### Summary: On the Impossibility of Informationally Efficient Markets By Grossman and Stiglitz
##### Seth Muhlestein - Fin 6470

Grossman and Stiglitz argue that perfectly efficient markets cannot exist. In the simplest of economic terms, the proper incentives for informationally efficient markets do not exist.

**Basic Assumptions**
    <ul><li>Two types of traders: Informed and Uninformed</li>
    <li>Two types of asset: Risky and Riskless</li>
    <li>Information is costly</li>
    <li>Traders must pay for information before the return of the risky asset is known</li></ul>

Because information is costly, it is assumed that having information gives a trader an advantage; informed traders will get a higher return on the risky asset. Without a higher return there is no incentive to acquire information. Once a trader with information acts in the marketplace, the information he has is diluted, or transmitted, to the uninformed trader through the price mechanism.

The idea is that at some point, the expected utility of both the informed and uninformed trader will be equal. That is the point which Grossman and Stiglitz refer to as the "equilibrium of disequilibrium." I think of it as the most efficient a market can be when information is costly. However, that point does not reflect an informationally efficient market because there must exist some sort of informational aribtrage for there to be any informed traders.

The model that Grossman and Stiglitz use demonstrates the effects of noise(false/incorrect information), risk aversion, cost of information, and quality of information.

**Key Takeaways From the Model**
    <ul>
    <li>Higher quality information improves the information transmitted by the price system</li>
    <li>As information becomes cheaper to obtain, the information in the price system improves</li>
    <li>A decrease in risk aversion for informed traders improves the information in the price system</li>
    <li>More noise has a net zero effect: accurate information becomes more valuable increasing the payoff from it, which leads to more traders becoming informed. More informed traders improves the information in the price system</li></ul>

**My Questions**
1. While it makes sense that trade would breakdown as noise decreased to zero--all economic incentives for arbitrage disappear at this point--it seems like trade should still occur. No one has exactly the amount of capital, goods, or labor needed for an indefinite amount of projects. If we reached the zero-noise point, wouldn't that be perfect for markets? All trades would be fair. *Fairness here relies solely on price, since that is the focus of the article. I'm leaving out risk, hedging, etc.*
2. In the last paragraph before section IV, I do not understand why speculative markets are composed solely of those with similar beliefs. All transactions require two parties with differing beliefs about the future.
3. **Talking Point:** Costless information is not just sufficient, but necessary for fully efficient markets.
