## Reading Summary for Nau (Module 01)

#### Arbitrage, Rationality, and Equilibrium
The no-arbitrage principle underpins rationality. Rather than being mathematical optimizers, people develop decision rules by interacting in the market. Rationality is then a direct result of arbitrageurs acting in the market place. Economic decision models can then be thought about in the basis of arbitrage.

**Key Point/My Thoughts**
-  "The competitive market can be thought of as a decentralized computational device in which myopic individual behavior serves to allocate production and consumptions through a process closely resembling the simplex algorithm of linear programming." Hence, optimization problems are simply the exploitation of arbitrage opportunities. That means that rationality is a top-down phenomena rather than an inherent trait. People learn to be rational by adapting to market signals. As Nau states, "Bayesians are made not born."
-  Beliefs, values, resource allocation, communication is all transferred through prices. People have to put their money where their mouth is.
    -  This ties beautifully with Hayek because prices should hold all relevant information.
-  de Finetti: "Prices should be interpreted as your probabilities and that the concept of probability has no other meaning beyond this."
-  Additivity: Separate, singular events that are each acceptable will be jointly acceptable.
    -  "There must exist a distribution under which every security's expected value, discounted at the riskless rate, lies between its advertised buying and selling prices."
        - Risk Neutral Probability distribution. Agent views these securities as fairly priced.
-  Beliefs and risk preferences cannot be separated. "The very act of hedging herself against the market...reveals everything which it is necessary to know about her personal beliefs and preferences."
-  Completeness: Learning is indistinguishable from hedging. Completeness is inessential for rationality with no-arbitrage.
-  Arbitrage and Equilibrium: There is arbitrage between personal, risk-neutral probabilities and market, risk-neutral probabilities. Firms, too, can take advantage of this. Some combination of market, risk-neutral probability and a security equals personal risk-neutral probability.
    -  Decision tree analysis should be replaced with Contingent Claims Analysis to capture arbitrage opportunities.
    -  Decisions arise in areas without securities or markets. Qualitative analysis then becomes more important.
    -  In a securities market, beliefs and risk preferences are determined by arbitrage through short-selling, options, etc.
-  I like that a premise of this paper is that preferences are revealed rather than simple known or unknowable. Revealed preferences tend to not contradict, which means time does not need to be spent an stated preferences. Marketing is sometimes seen as discovering preferences; I think it is an influencer of preferences rather than a discoverer of them. Market analysis then is akin to stated preferences; whereas, transactional analysis is akin to revealed preferences.

**My Questions**
1. Is arbitrage underappreciated in economics because it is seen as a mechanism of prices? That is, arbitrage itself is an action and not an in-born trait. Economics is enamored with describing peoples actions. Is it missing out on the key incentive? (Although it would be hard to measure/model).
2. I think Nau makes a pretty convincing argument about arbitrage being key to rationality and economics. Is he just not well-known? Or is there some other reason his work isn't used often in economics?
