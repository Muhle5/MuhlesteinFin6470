### Summary: Economic Theory and Equilibrium; The Social Functions of Derivatives by Culp

##### Economic Theory and Equilibrium
Culp discusses the evolution of economic thought and specifically about the concept of equilibrium. The first major point is that economics has created barriers to entry through empirical methods that make it inaccessible to your everyday average Joe. This differs from the first economists from which the current discipline takes its basic ideologies. The likes of Adam Smith, Karl Marx, Thomas Malthus, David Ricardo, etc. were thought leaders--borderline philosophers--who based ideas on policy changes rather than empirical models. Essentially, economics is marginalized because it is inaccessible and not understood.

While each classical economist has a ideological base, Culp focuses on Neoclassicals, Austrians, and Neo-Austrians; this is where the differences of thought about the concept of equilibrium emerge.

**Key Points**
<ul>
  <li>*Classical:* The concept of equilibrium in the classical school of thought was expressed as a "natural rate." That means all goods in an economy--particularly capital and labor--were set by supply. Only a shift in supply could change that natural rate.</li>
  <li>*Neoclassicals:* In this school of thought, equilibrium is a steady state. Marginal utility is used as the building block. By thinking at the margin, an individual sets demand for a good by the extra utility he/she will get from the good. If this state is steady, then it should be possible to calculate an equilibrium that always holds. In essence, there is a "Law of One Price" that governs goods. The shortcoming of this idea is that this one-price is unknown. The concept of an Auctioneer is presented by Leon Walras; the auctioneer calls out a price until a transaction clears, which is where the marginal demand equals marginal utility. When this is equal across all goods everywhere, you satisfy the Law of One Price.</li>
  <li>*Austrian:* Two main differences separate Neoclassicals and Austrians. The first is the use of mathematical models. In the field of economics, empirical methods/modeling has become the hallmark of a great economist. That led to the ideas of the Austrian school being diminished. The second, and more important difference, is what fundamentally separates the two schools. Austrians think that prices tend towards an equilibrium point. That means equilibrium is not a fixed, steady state. In essence, the study of equilibrium equates to a study of *disequilibrium*. Constant information flow means prices are not at equilibrium--and if they are it's not for long.</li>
  <li>*Neo-Austrian:* As the name suggests, Neo-Austrianism merges the two schools of thought. The empirical tools and models from the Neoclassicals are used with the idea that markets and prices are in a state of disequilibrium. I think of it this way: if prices *tend* toward an equilibrium point, then using the concept of a steady equilibrium should provide a roadmap to how well a market system is functioning. I need to include concepts such as volatility, liquidity, frictional costs, bid-ask spreads, etc. for this to work. Those concepts allow for the explanation of deviations from the equilibrium. The assumption that equilibrium is never quite known is also needed.</li></ul>

  **My Questions**
  1. We are developing empirical methods as part of our skillset. How do we bridge the gap to those who lack the mathematical know-how to understand models and practices?
  2. On Marshallian Equilibrium: Shouldn't there always be a disequilibrium? Assuming a profit motive (and I'm not sure Marshallian Equilibrium does), no firm/individual would operate where marginal costs were equal to marginal revenue. Then, there would always be a race to lower costs, improve technology, or collude. I think this is what we see. Thoughts?
  3. Culp briefly mentions this, but isn't another massive critique of Neoclassicals that utility isn't comparable across individuals? In macroeconomics, we typically assume that all people are the same; that is needed for a model to be scalable. We know that isn't the case. I think the concept of subjective value is an important critique.

##### The Social Functions of Financial Derivatives
Culp talks about the functions that derivatives play in markets and the positive societal benefits that come from them.

**Key Points**
<ul>
  <li>*Facilitate Risk Transfer:* Derivatives give investors/managers/firms the ability
  to choose which risks they want to take on. As the paper says, it's a more surgical approach.
  This precision allows firms to guard against detrimental and/or excessive risks that affect business decisions. Once those risks are transferred, they firms can focus on their informational comparative advantages, which are likely the revenue producing parts of the business. Since comparative advantage is a basic tenant of economics, derivatives find themselves at the heart of basic business thought.</li>
  <li>*Price Discovery:* Derivatives decrease barriers to trade by lowering costs. Lower costs boost liquidity and expand the number of market participants. Using Hayek's idea of price discovery (or Adam Smith's invisible hand), increased trading activity allows for aggregation and transfer of more information. Not only do derivatives create new markets that add information to existing market structures, but they also enhance information flow across the board. More/better information sets market-wide expectations --> common expectations leads to less volatility --> less volatility leads to more trade --> more trade leads to more price discovery --> and the cycle continues</li>
  <li>*Allocate Scarce Resources Now and Intertemporally:* This is part of the surgical risk transfer. Firms decide how commodities should be delivered. They can synthetically store resources, lock in prices creating stability, and view implied interest rates which set market outlooks. As with other market functions, if the "cost of carry" (equivalent to an interest rate on a loan) is not priced correctly, arbitrage will occur. Arbitrage opportunities bring more traders to the market until that opportunity is gone. Institutional frictions limit efficiency in allocating these resources.</li>
  <li>*Increase Access to Assets Classes:* Commodity loans can substitute financial loans. Repo markets improve liquidity. Sourcing through intermediaries becomes viable--banks can lock in a price of a commodity as the intermediary for a sourcing transactions (coffee from Brazil to Switzerland). </li>
  <li>*Limit Underinvestment through Asset-backed Financing:* Derivatives provide opportunities to invest in asset classes that would otherwise be too expensive. Things like volatility become trade-able assets with derivatives.</li>
</ul>

**My Questions**

1. Why and when do contango and backwardation occur? What are some real life examples? What trading strategies take advantage of these events?
2. If convenience yield is equivalent to dividends/coupons, do we ever see a comparison of their returns? Maybe a better way to phrase it is this: Do we consider the cost of "commoditization" the same way we would cost of debt or cost of capital?
3. All financial instruments are subject to losses. Why then are derivatives vilified? Leveraging and short-selling provide valuable information to markets. It's not the financial instruments fault that people do not pay attention.
