## Reading Summary for Hayek (Module 01)

#### The Use of Knowledge in Society
Hayek discusses his thoughts on information aggregation in an economy through a price system. The idea that sparked this paper seems to be a rebuttal to the idea of an "auctioneer" who sets clearing prices in an economy. Also, the idea that the "economic calculus" used to solve economic problems doesn't fully encompass the reality of economic problems society faces. The idea is that information is too disperse for a single mind to plan out an economy--as this auctioneer would; rationality is also a bit in question because of contradictory information in markets, which shouldn't happen to an all-knowing, rational, planning mind. These bits of local, dispersed knowledge can only be acted upon immediately if there is some way to incorporate that information. Since the information is unique and local, only a market mechanism would be able to transmit that message immediately.

**Key Points/My Thoughts**
-  The problem that society faces is allocating scarce resources to their best uses. The typical word to describe this idea is planning, as Hayek states. The problem is that no one person/entity has the capacity to do planning on an economy wide scale. So, the question boils down to who will do the planning? Should planning be centralized or decentralized? Concentrated of dispersed?
-  Arbitrageurs and those with comparative advantages play an integral part to society because they take advantage of unique, local knowledge. As they do so, the rest of society becomes aware of the new information. The idea that this is "dishonest" hurts economies. The idea pervades that any new knowledge should be immediately and readily be at the use of everybody. *My thought on this are that without this incentive, innovation would slow if not halt. That would be a poor outcome for all involved*
-  The main problem with centralized planning is that it is done on the aggregate, which disregards small fluctuations in local areas. As Hayek says, the statistical measures used to plan do not help with information flow that the "man on the spot" would add. Basically, one size does not fit all.
-  Here is where prices come into play. With decentralized information, each "man on the spot" cannot know changes in information elsewhere. However, he does not need to with prices. The only thing he has to know is if the price went up or down. For him and his planning, he just needs that signal to make his plans. He can make decisions with prices based on the opportunity cost of allocating his own scarce resources.
-  As each "man on the spot" allocates his resources, the market begins to act as a single rational mind. That is, prices--including consideration for transportation, etc.--reflect almost the exact same message to each local market.
-  Hayek only briefly mentions rigid, or sticky, prices. However, to me this is huge. The more interference the market faces--from government or poor competition--the more sticky prices become and the worse the price system functions. The distortions decrease overall wealth.
-  No alternative system has been designed. Spontaneous order allowed for the creation of an efficient and effective information transfer system.

**My Questions**
1. Hayek talks about the midway point between a single plan or many plans, which he characterizes as competition. Is he suggesting that an economy of monopolies would be best? Industry or knowledge monopolies seem dangerous in my opinion.
2. New technologies such as bitcoin--under lied by the block chain--should improve information flow. Bitcoin allows for anonymity and so we should see more revealed preferences about the actors in the economy. The block chain keeps a record of all transactions, which keeps information pure and accurate. Less noise should also positively affect the market. What other technologies have the capability to do the same?

#### The Theory of Complex Phenomena
In this paper Hayek talks about economics as a science. He discusses the differences in the physical and social sciences. He talks about mans need for understanding and that man uses observation to discover patterns. However, man may be wrong in assuming/thinking that if he observes sufficient natural occurrences, a pattern will always arise. In the end, some things are just more complex than others. " What we must get rid of is the na√Øve superstition that the world must be so organized that it is possible by direct observation to discover simple regularities between all phenomena and that this is a necessary presupposition for the application of the scientific method...if we want to get ahead in these fields our aims will have to be somewhat different form what they are in the fields of simple phenomena."

**Key Points/My Thoughts**
-  A complex model is still simpler than life. Mathematical models in hard sciences often describe observations. They aren't, then, necessarily predictive but descriptive. Economics, on the other hand, tries to be predictive but can't do so because it's not always descriptive either. Economics deals with independent actors whose decisions aren't (always) affected by gravity, mass, etc.
    - Imagine a pool of atomic particles. If you knew the exact composition (how many electrons, protons, etc.), could you predict which molecules would form? I'm not sure you could. I think you'd have to know speeds of each particle, pressure, heat, etc. I think a market is similar. We may know its composition, but we don't know enough about the "heat, pressure, and speed."
-  Science must be willing to explore two directions: the direction in which theories and patterns are falsifiable and repetitive; and, the direction in which theories only somewhat describe phenomena too complex to be falsifiable by typical scientific standards.
-  I loved the paragraph about evolution. Hayek describes a scenario in which man and ape are not two branches from a common ancestor but a convergent branch from unique ancestors. This wouldn't make Darwin's theory wrong, it would just mean that the application of it was at least incomplete. Economics is actually quite similar to evolution (at least as we currently understand it). Both are pretty good at looking backward, but both are pretty poor predictors of the future. Mutations occur at a predictable rate, but knowing which mutations will actually lead to survival and natural selection is almost impossible. Market movements occur (business cycles, regime changes, etc.), but it's almost impossible to know when and exactly what precipitates those movements.
-  What makes markets/financial actors so difficult to model is that they know how they are being measured!
-  "The more we learn about the world, and the deeper our learning, the more conscious, specific, and articulate will be our knowledge of what we do not know, our knowledge of our ignorance."


**My Questions**
1. Because physics, biology, etc. have recurring patterns that do not change and easily spotted anomalies does that make them simpler than economics?
2. Hayek seems to say that economics is only meant to outline general conditions. Do you think that if more people accepted a stochastic, bayesian approach to economics that it could become more predictive/descriptive?
3. Tradeoff: Are we more hurt or protected intellectually by narrowly defining science?
